## Current reference docs

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`
Onboarding and contributor guide. Covers:
- Quick start (clone to first processed image)
- Understanding the 3-surface architecture
- Test image catalog (14 images, what each scenario exercises)
- "Where do I start?" — task to code navigation
- How to add a new pipeline step (5-file pattern)
- Testing guide (what each suite covers, how to write tests)
- Commit and PR conventions

Read this first if you're new to the project.

### `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
**The canonical reference.** Covers:
- High-level architecture (CLI, macOS app, web/AWS)
- Image processing pipeline — steps, execution model, storage abstraction
- Key technical decisions (why OpenAI for glare, why Hough rotation is disabled, etc.)
- AWS resource names, environments (dev/prod), CI/CD workflows
- API key resolution, authentication flow, WebSocket live progress
- Planned / not yet built

Read this first when orienting to the project or making architectural decisions.

### `PIPELINE_STEPS.md`
Per-step implementation reference. For each pipeline step:
- What it does and which algorithm/model it uses
- Tunable `PipelineConfig` parameters
- Debug output files it produces
- Known limitations and disabled paths

Read this when working on a specific pipeline step or tuning output quality.
